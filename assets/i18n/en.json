    "p2": "After a long period of inactivity and following his time with the Madrid-based band Magnética, it emerges as a result of the experiences lived before, during, and after pausing the musical journey out of mere vital necessity. \n Produced by Carly Yeah and recorded during 2023 and early this year, the album gathers passages that remained abandoned to their fate and have been rescued and treated with care to shed light and context on each and every one of the experiences since then, regardless of time or distance. \n \n The first live dates where you can enjoy the performance will be announced soon; until then, we will continue to inform through our social media.",
